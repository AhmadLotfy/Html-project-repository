<h3>When you turn on your computer, it's nice to think that you're in control.</h3>
<h3>There's the trusty computer mouse, which you can move anywhere on the screen, summoning up your music library or Internet browser at the slightest whim.</h3>
<h3>Although it's easy to feel like a director in front of your desktop or laptop, there's a lot going on inside, and the real man behind the curtain handling the necessary tasks is the operating system.</h3>
<h3>Most desktop or laptop PCs come pre-loaded with Microsoft Windows. Macintosh computers come pre-loaded with Mac OS X. Many corporate servers use the Linux or UNIX operating systems.</h3>
<h3>The operating system (OS) is the first thing loaded onto the computer -- without the operating system, a computer is useless.</h3>
