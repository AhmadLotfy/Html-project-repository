<h2>Apple’s marketing for the introduction of the Macintosh focused heavily on its operating system’s intuitive ease of use.</h2>
<h2> Unlike virtually all other contemporary PCs, the Mac OS (initially designated simply System Software, with a version number appended) was graphically based.</h2>
<h2>Rather than typing commands and directory paths at text prompts, users moved a mouse pointer to visually navigate the Finder—a series of virtual folders and files, represented by icons.</h2>
<h2> Most computer operating systems eventually adopted the GUI model.</h2>
